# nicholas-dalzell-project2

This will be the github repo for my project 2.

I created a web application which displays a list of cocktail recipes. Using MongoDB, NodeJS, and React to set up the front end, back end server and client. There is an API post form for creating the new cocktail recipe object. I created API structures with the ability to edit and delete these cocktail recipes after they are posted.
